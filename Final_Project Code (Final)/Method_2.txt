Public-Key Encryption

Pulic-Key encrytion is the most commonly used encryption method for internet and database
password security. This method works by using a pivate key (your password) converted into
a very large (usually prime) number and a public key (another large number) and multiplying
them together. This method works as long as the pivate key is kept private because the only
way to decypher, even with access to the public key is to find the number (your password) that
was multiplied by the public key.
