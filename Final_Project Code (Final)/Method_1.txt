Shift Encryption

Shift encrytion shifts every character in a string over a previously specified 
length. If the shift would cause the letter to go passed 'z' the next letter would be
'a' as you would simply restart from the beginning of the alphabet.

For example, the string, "Hello zebra", shift encrypted 3 spots would be "Khoor Cheudv".
